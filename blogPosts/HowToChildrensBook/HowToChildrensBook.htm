<h1 style="text-align:center">My First Illustrated Children's Book</h1>

<p> I did this because I wanted to learn how to do it. I am not an artist but I enjoy learning. 
	This is my first illustrated children's book. It is about cats that know fung fu and their adventures.  </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Topic</h1>

<p>Well, if you have a story in mind then do that. However, if you are looking to make money, then you will have to pick a niche. 
	This can be challenging and you will need to do some research. 
	But in general, if you treat this as a product, then making something people want or need is really important. 
	See below in the publishing section for additional recommendations. </p>


<h1 style="text-align:center">Writing</h1>

<p> Writing can be tough. But there are approaches to follow to write a good story. One approach is to follow Dan Harmon's (creator of Rick and Morty) Story Circle.  </p>


	<center><img src="images/storyCircle.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 400px;" /></center>

<p>It is a good way to structure your story and many episodes of Rick and Morty were written in this way. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Drawing and Illustrating</h1>

<p>Here I will recommend the books that helped me to learn how to draw. No, I am no artist but there are steps to drawing that can be learned. 
	Obviously, you will need to draw and color digitally so here I will also list the software and hardware I used.   </p>



<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3YvaDO7">How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way  </a></li>
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ktwpw3">Cartoon Animation  </a></li>
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/47i52il">The Animator's Survival Kit </a></li>
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3KvhtNK">The Art of Rick and Morty </a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Software and Hardware</h3>
<p>The software I use is called TVpaint. It is for 2D animation. I really like it.
	The hardware I used is a wacom tablet and it is the best I have found for digital hand drawing. There are different sizes. What you get will depend on your budget.  </p>
	
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.tvpaint.com">TVpaint</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3s9rIkv">Wacom Cintiq 13HD Drawing Tablet (older) </a></li>
	<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3YsMszN">Wacom Cintiq 16 Drawing Tablet (newer)</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Publishing</h1>

<p> This assumes you want to self publish with Amazon. Their service is called KDP. You can just google Amazon KDP. 
	Here are some recommendations when publishing with Amazon: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Children's book are not long so you can start with about 40 panels. </li>
	<li>Choose the right name for your book</li>
	<li>Choose the right key words for your book</li>
	<li>You will need to budget to advertise on amazon (amazon ads)</li>
	<li>Submit your work to competitions and forums</li>
</ul>



<h1 style="text-align:center">Merch</h1>

<p> When you draw, keep the backgrounds in a different layer. That way you can use your illustrations without background for your merchandise. 
	Amazon Merch is a part of amazon you can use to make and sell merchandise. See an example below.  </p>


<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22The+House+of+the+Flying+Kitties%22&crid=2X18X0ZNAIL88&sprefix=the+house+of+the+flying+kitties+%2Caps%2C96&ref=nb_sb_noss">Merch example </a></li>
	
</ul>
