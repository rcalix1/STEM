<h1 style="text-align:center">My First Illustrated Children's Book</h1>

<p> I did this because I wanted to learn how to do it. I am not an artist but I enjoy learning. 
	This is my first illustrated children's book. It is about cat that know fung fu and their adventures.  </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Topic</h1>

<p>Well, if you have a story in mind then do that. However, if you are looking to make money, then you will have to pick a niche. 
	This can be challenging and you will need to do some research. 
	But in general, if you treat this as a product, then making something people want or need is really important. 
	See below in the publishing section for additional recommendations. </p>


<h1 style="text-align:center">Writing</h1>

<p> Writing can be tough. But there are approaches to follow to write a good story. One approach is to follow Dan Harmon's (creator of Rick and Morty)  </p>


	<center><img src="images/storyCircle.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 400px;" /></center>

<p>It is a good way to structure your story and many episodes of Rick and Morty were written in this way. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Drawing and Illustrating</h1>

<p>Here I will recommend the 3 books that helped me to learn how to draw. No, I am no artist but there are steps to drawing that can be learned. 
	Obviously, you will need to draw and color digitally so here I will also list the software and hardware I used.   </p>

<p> I used a 3D printer. I experimented with 2 printers as I was learning but found one to be the best for this and actually was really happy with it.  </p>

<p>The 3D printer that I preferred for this build is the Kobra Max from Anycubic. This is the sponsored link 
	which supports this content <a href="https://amzn.to/44oiaAz">Kobra Max 3D printer</a></p>

<p>This printer is big but can print all parts. And I really like the bed of it. The parts stick really well. </p>
