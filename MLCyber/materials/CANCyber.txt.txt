CAN network attacks

Hackers are attacking CAN networks of 2016-2018 luxury sedans. 
You are tasked with designing a machine learning based approach to detect attacks in these CAN NETWORKS. 
There is currently no data so you will need to obtain it or create it. 
CAN networks are basically computer bus type communication lines in a car that allow signals to be transmitted between different sensors of the car. 
Think of the signals as very simple network packets 
How would you approach this problem? Suggest a machine learning pipeline that you could use and define the following:

some of the features you could use
how would you obtain the labels
what is an instance?
draw your X and y matrices
